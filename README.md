# Barrel-Shifter
A barrel shifter is a combinational circuit used in digital design for shifting or rotating data efficiently. It takes an input data word and performs shifts (left or right) or rotations by a specified number of positions in a single clock cycle, without the need for iterative operations.

# Key features of a barrel shifter:

Efficiency: Performs shifts and rotations in constant time, making it suitable for high-speed applications.
Applications: Commonly used in ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units), cryptography, and signal processing.
Implementation: Typically realized using multiplexers in hardware, enabling simultaneous handling of all bits.
